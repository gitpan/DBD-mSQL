DBD::mSQL for DBI - Written by Alligator Descartes <descarte@mcqueen.com>

18/07/95:	Started. 

		Version 0.0.0 ( Totally pre-alpha! )

19/07/95:22:00	Code now basically seems to work. I've got connection to
		a database, and clean disconnection.

	 23:45	I'm now working on the statement cycle stuff, which I've
		mapped out. It's just a case of coding, which shouldn't
		take too long, hopefully.

		Posted notice of approaching doom to perldb-interest.

20/07/95:01:25	Fetching appears to work OK now. I need to read the API on
		msqlFieldSeek, since I can't work out why fetch is returning
		the same row over and over! 

21/07/95:09:22  Added a field into imp_sth (currow) which keeps track of the
                current row that's been fetched from the result struct. If I
                can fix the return codes coming from fetchrow, it'll work!

21/07/95:10:30  Pondered bind variables in cursors. Since there isn't a bind
                function in the API, I may have to frig the way that prepare/
                execute works, ie, move the call to msqlQuery *after* it's
                done some parsing for bind values......Hm.

21/07/95:10:35  Twiddled some bits in the fetchrow cycle. 

23/07/95:15:50  Fetch is fetching a row, but it's not returning it to the 
        	calling cycle, so I need to fart about with the sv stuff, which
		is not amusing me greatly!

26/07/95:23:42	Decided in agreement with Andreas that the first release is
		to be 0.61! 

27/07/95:14:14	Finally! It fucking works! After splendid quantities of
      		hacking around with the prepare/execute/fetchrow/finish cycle
		it's actually returning rows correctly!

		NOTE: The SV handling within dbd_describe is shot to buggery,
		      but I've kludged it in mSQL.xs::fetchrow to do a
		      sv_2mortal instead of a sv_mortalcopy.

27/07/95:14:22	Tidied up mSQL.xs::finish to do an msqlFreeResult. Annoyingly
		enough, there's no return code to msqlFR, so I can't test 
		whether or not it's worked! Bah!

27/07/95:15:15	Altered test to do several bits and bobs. I'm testing INSERT
		statements now. These only execute an msqlQuery, but the
		stuff needs to continue to pass through the execute and finish
		stages cleanly.......*sigh*

27/07/95:15:22	My dubious 'INSERT' check hack works, sort of. Pity it converts
		the entire statement to lower case.....! 

27/07/95:17:33	Twiddled some more stuff so it seems to do CREATE TABLE,
		INSERT statements too. Of course, there's no error checking
		yet, but it seems to be OK........Hm.

27/07/95:17:38	Mailed out a statement saying the 0.61 code would be up for
		grabs as of Monday 31st July! Still waiting on Alpha reports.

27/07/95:12:11	Fixed the lower-case all the INSERT/CREATE &c. statement bug.
		It now checks to see if you're in quotes.

28/07/95:xx:xx	Got a report back from Andreas to say  compilation barfs on
		his Indy. Fixed a load of do_error bugs in dbdimp.c. 

13/08/95:18:25  Finally got back to this after a rather long break. Fixed some
		Makefile.PL bugs that were kicking about. Finally fixed
		( or appeared to fix ) the strlen signedness bug in dbdimp.c
		that may halt compilation on the Indy. 

		Emailed Karsten the debug info to see what's causing problems
		on the NeXTStep platform.

14/08/95:13:48	Got email back from Andreas. signedness broke mSQL.xs as well!
		Fixed that and emailed him a quick patch.

14/08/94:14:45	Andreas now has a successful compile. The tests are crap, but
		appear to ( sort of ) work.

29/08/95:23:18	Converted driver across to new DBI format. It now appears
		to compile, install and run fairly reasonably. There are
		some serious messes that need cleared up in it, but it's
		fundamentally OK, I hope. Announced for pl0 testing.

04/09/95:15:04	Started back on getting the 0.60pl0 out. Tidied up the parsing
   		of statements for INSERT, CREATE &c statements. It just takes
		the first word of the statement now.

04/09/95:15:19	Looks OK. Tested against DBI 0.63 and looks reasonable.
		Announced release of 0.60pl1 and put up for ftp.

20/09/95:15:20	Patched a load of stuff including NULLs, and local device
		handling ( SV ). Released pl4, which was bogus. Released
		pl5 which should fix those issues.

20/09/95:22:17	Fixed overhang of old DBI bug with DBIc_ENDING remaining in
		DESTROY in mSQL.xs. Spotted by Marti Rijken and fixed.
		( Hopefully! )

18/10/95:15:13	Added in the missing API chunks for ListTables, ListDBs
		and ListFields.

		ListFields isnae working, but I'll fix that sometime soon....

05/11/95:11:32	Fixed $sth->readblob to return undef. Fixed Makefile.PL, 
		dbdimp.h, mSQL.h, dbdimp.c for release of 0.60pl7. Also tested
		'make test' which now works!

23/11/95:19:22	Fixed ListFields from the pointers given to me by Sven V.

24/11/95:03:13	Fixed error handling in all the func methods

24/11/95:13:01	Added 'NumRows' method to statement handles to return the
		number of rows returned ( or affected ) by a statement.o

		pre-release distributed to ANDK
