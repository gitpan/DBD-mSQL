WARNING: THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE. IT IS POSSIBLY UNRELIABLE!

BEFORE BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

    Build, test and install Perl 5.
    It is very important to test it and install it!

    Build, test and install the DBI module.
    It is very important to test it and install it!

    Read this file thoroughly.

    Read the WWW pages at: http://www.hermetica.com/technologia/perl/DBI
    especially the specific information for this driver and the ``Frequently 
    Asked Questions''.

BUILDING

    If Perl5 is installed do:

	perl Makefile.PL

    If Perl5 is NOT installed do:

	perl Makefile.PL PERL_SRC=/path/to/perl/source/dir

    Then do:

	make
	make test
	make test TEST_VERBOSE=1   (if any tests fail)

Do NOT hand edit the generated Makefile unless you are completely sure
you understand the implications! Always try to make changes via the
Makefile.PL command line and/or editing the Makefile.PL.

You should never need to make any changes. If you do *please* let me
know so that I can try to make it automatic in a later release.

Testing: The test program auto-searches your local mSQL databases for a
         suitable one to use for testing. If you do *NOT* want this to happen
         please edit 'test.pl' and follow the instructions at the top. The
         test software does not discriminate between working databases and
         development ones!

Additional Tests: Some additional test scripts are available in the
                  'extratests/' directory. These include scripts to exercise
                  creation and deletion of databases. Please use with
                  discretion and care.

If the message at the end of testing:

	** Testing of DBD::mSQL complete! You appear to be normal! ***

appears, then you can complete the driver installation by typing:

	make install

IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:

Please read the DBI WWW pages at:

	http://www.hermetica.com/technologia/DBI

for any pertinent outstanding build issues for your platform.

Also, please post details to dbi-users@fugue.com and CC them to me at
descarte@hermetica.com.  Please include:

1. A complete log of a complete build, e.g.:

	perl Makefile.PL           (do a make realclean first)
	make
	make test
	make test TEST_VERBOSE=1 PERL_DBI_DEBUG=2   (if any tests fail)

2. Full details of which version of mSQL and Perl you're using.

3. The output of:
	perl -e 'use Config; print Config::myconfig()'

4. If you get a core dump, try to include a stack trace from it.
   If the stack trace mentions XS_DynaLoader_dl_load_file then rerun
   make test after setting the environment variable PERL_DL_DEBUG to 2.
   Retrieve the Devel::Corestack module from CPAN to aid you in the 
   production of stack traces ( http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ ).

5. Please don't post problems to comp.lang.perl.misc, comp.lang.perl.modules
   or perl-porters.
