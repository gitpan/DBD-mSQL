	o Added code to plug some memory leaks
	o Added experimental Msqlperl emulation
	o Brought .xs and mSQL interface code in line with DBD::Oracle
	o Fixed 'connect' call arguments
	o Removed a lot of dead code
	o Added some other methods for mSQL/Msqlperl emulation and flexibility
	o Added mSQL version 2 support
	o Made the Makefile.PL a bit more auto-configurey, in that it should
	  try and detect what version of mSQL you have installed and are attempting
	  to build against

	o Altered mSQL.xs::st::DESTROY to stop blabbering about sth's
          "destroyed without finish". Blame Doug MacEachern for this one....

	o Altered mSQL.xs to put msqlFreeResult in the correct place in each
	  of the 'func' calls. It was getting called even if the routine to
          populate the struct to be freed failed..........Which resulted in
          a core. Thanks to Robert C. Hinds for producing a detailed error 
	  log for me to fix.

	o Added 'length' key into the hash returned by func( '_ListFields' )

	o Altered mSQL.pm to allow hostname:port style connection strings. This
	  directly sets MSQL_TCP_PORT. If port isn't specified it unsets
	  MSQL_TCP_PORT and you're in the lap of the gods.......

0.60pl8

	o Added error string and number to 'func' methods

	o Completed implementation of 'ListFields' invoked through the
	  'func' method

	o Added implementation of 'CreateDB' and 'DropDB' through the
	  'func' method

	o Added a method 'NumRows' against $sth to show the number of
	  rows returned by a statement.

0.60pl7

	o Fixed $DBI::errnum/$DBI::errstr problems, ie, it wasn't being 
	  returned back into the invoking program.

	  ( Thanks to Sven Verdoolaege for the patches )

	o Fixed DROP, DELETE &c blah. Missing '= 1' variable set.

	  ( Thanks again to SV )

	o Added ListDBs and ListTables to the driver via the
	  'func' method. ListFields is still under implementation. ( By the
	  next full version )

	o Rewrote the test script to execise the whole driver. ( Should keep
	  Andreas happy! 8-) ). The test still needs to exercise multiple
	  simultaneous database connections and cursors, but we'll wworry about
	  that in the next release.

	o Tidied up stray declarations in the includes, so we have warning-free
	  compiles ( hopefully! )

	o Tidied up Makefile.PL to remove all the Oracle-isms from the code.

	o Fixed \$sth->readblob method to return undef.

	o Removed old Msqlperl tests to stop confusing people......
