0.60pl7

	o Fixed $DBI::errnum/$DBI::errstr problems, ie, it wasn't being 
	  returned back into the invoking program.

	  ( Thanks to Sven Verdoolaege for the patches )

	o Fixed DROP, DELETE &c blah. Missing '= 1' variable set.

	  ( Thanks again to SV )

	o Added ListDBs and ListTables to the driver via the
	  'func' method. ListFields is still under implementation. ( By the
	  next full version )

	o Rewrote the test script to execise the whole driver. ( Should keep
	  Andreas happy! 8-) ). The test still needs to exercise multiple
	  simultaneous database connections and cursors, but we'll wworry about
	  that in the next release.

	o Tidied up stray declarations in the includes, so we have warning-free
	  compiles ( hopefully! )

	o Tidied up Makefile.PL to remove all the Oracle-isms from the code.

	o Fixed \$sth->readblob method to return undef.

	o Removed old Msqlperl tests to stop confusing people......
